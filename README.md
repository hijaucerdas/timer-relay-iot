In the digital era, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a role in saving electricity in a smarter and more automatic way. 
IoT allows real-time monitoring and control of electrical devices, thereby reducing energy waste.
Therefore, I developed a simple system that can control the machine via the internet (web server) and monitor the electricity consumption in real-time and remotely. 
This system is designed to improve the efficiency of energy use by providing ease of operation and monitoring of the device directly through a web-based interface.
